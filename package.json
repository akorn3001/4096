  "description": "4096 is a single-player sliding-block puzzle game. The game is played on a square board with 16 squares, some of which are populated with numbers (all being powers of 2) - the rest of the squares are empty. The user can swipe left, right, up, and down which causes any available number-tiles to slide as far as they can in the direction of the swipe. Each time a swipe occurs a new number-tile is generated in a random empty location. When two number-tiles of the same value collide, they collapse into a single number-tile whose value is equal to the sum of the two. The object of the game is to get as high a number as possible before the board fills up.",
