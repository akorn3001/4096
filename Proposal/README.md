# JS Project Proposal: 4096
### About 4096
4096 is a single-player sliding-block puzzle game. The game is played on a square board with 16 squares, some of which are populated with numbers (all being powers of 2) - the rest of the squares are empty. The user can swipe left, right, up, and down which causes any available number-tiles to slide as far as they can in the direction of the swipe. Each time a swipe occurs a new number-tile is generated in a random empty location. When two number-tiles of the same value collide, they collapse into a single number-tile whose value is equal to the sum of the two. The object of the game is to get as high a number as possible before the board fills up.

### MVP
To meet requirements necessary for playability, the game must meet the following criteria:
- Number-tiles slide until they hit the wall or another number whose value does not equal the value of the sliding tile
- When two number-tiles of equal value collide, they collapse into a single tile whose value is equal to the sum of the two tiles
- With each swipe a new number-tile is generated in a random empty location
- The `Score` box will keep track of the user's current score, which will be calculated from all of the collapse events

### Wireframes
The game will display the 4 x 4 grid along with the user's current and best scores. Controls for the game will be the arrow keys allowing the user to pick which direction they wish to swipe.

### Technologies and Libraries

In addition to using `JavaScript` for implementing game logic, I will use `webpack` for bundling script files and `Moustrap.js` for binding keyboard events. CSS3 will be used for the sliding animations for the number-tiles.

### Implementation Timeline
#### Day 1
Plan out the game logic without any styling or sliding animations. Especially work out the logic related to tile-collapse when two tiles share the same number. Break out sliding logic into up and down directions.

#### Day 2
Spend part of Day 2 learning `Moustrap` for the purpose of binding keyboard events for the up, left, down, and right arrows. Track player's score.

#### Day 3
Leverage CSS3's animation effects for slick transitions of moving tiles.

### Bonus Features
- Dropdown menu to change tile and background colors
